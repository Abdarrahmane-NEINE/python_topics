    "## 2. Integration Tests\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "Confirm that multiple parts of the system work together correctly (e.g., view logic interacting with the database).\n",

    "- **Integration Tests** validate that Django views, URL routing, and database interactions work together.\n",
    "- **Contract Tests** guarantee that your API meets consumer expectations.\n",
    "- **End-to-End Tests** simulate full user interactions to verify the entire systemâ€™s behavior.\n",
