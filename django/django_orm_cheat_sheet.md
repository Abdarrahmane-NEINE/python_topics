## 1. Querying Basics

### 1.1. `all()`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.all()
```

#### Example:
```python
entries = Entry.objects.all()
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Retrieves a QuerySet containing every record of the model.
- **Usage**: Think of it as “select everything” from the table.
- **When Evaluated**: Although this appears to run immediately, Django QuerySets are lazy—meaning that the database query isn’t actually executed until you iterate over the QuerySet or otherwise force evaluation.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM entry;
```

---

### 1.2. `filter(**kwargs)`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.filter(**kwargs)
```

#### Example:
```python
# Get all entries published on or before January 1, 2006 and with status "published".
Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__lte="2006-01-01", status="published")
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Filters records that meet the specified conditions.
- **Keyword Arguments**:
  - Each `**kwargs` represents a condition in the form `field__lookup=value`.
  - In the example, `pub_date__lte="2006-01-01"` uses the `__lte` lookup:
    - `__lte` stands for “less than or equal to”.
    - Similarly, lookups like `__gte` (greater than or equal), `__lt` (less than), and `__gt` (greater than) are used for numerical or date comparisons.
  - `status="published"` is a shorthand for `status__exact="published"`, where `__exact` checks for exact equality.
- **Combining Conditions**: Multiple keyword arguments are automatically combined with an AND operation.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM entry
WHERE pub_date <= '2006-01-01' AND status = 'published';
```

#### Other Common Lookups:
- `__icontains`: Case-insensitive containment test (e.g., `title__icontains="django"` finds titles containing “django” regardless of case).
- `__contains`: Case-sensitive
- `__in`: Checks if a field’s value is within a given list (e.g., `status__in=["published", "review"]`).
- `__startswith / __istartswith`: Checks if a field starts with a certain string (case-sensitive or insensitive).
- `__endswith / __iendswith`: Checks if a field ends with a certain string.

**Tip**: All lookups are appended to the field name with two underscores (`__`) to separate the field from the lookup.

---

### 1.3. `exclude(**kwargs)`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.exclude(**kwargs)
```

#### Example:
```python
# Get all entries except those with status 'draft'
Entry.objects.exclude(status='draft')
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Retrieves records that do not match the given conditions.
- **Behavior**: Works like `filter()`, but negates the conditions.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM entry
WHERE NOT (status = 'draft');
```

- **Usage**: Combine with other filters if needed; each condition in `exclude()` is negated.

---

### 1.4. `get(**kwargs)`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.get(**kwargs)
```

#### Example:
```python
# Get the entry with primary key 1.
Entry.objects.get(id=1)
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Retrieves a single object that matches the criteria.
- **Important Behavior**:
  - If exactly one object is found, it is returned.
  - If no objects match, a `DoesNotExist` exception is raised.
  - If more than one object matches, a `MultipleObjectsReturned` exception is raised.
- **When to Use**: Use `get()` when you expect a unique record (e.g., using a primary key or unique field).

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM entry WHERE id = 1;
```

---

### 1.5. `order_by(*fields)`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.order_by(*fields)
```

#### Example:
```python
# Order entries by publication date descending.
Entry.objects.order_by('-pub_date')
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Orders (sorts) a QuerySet by one or more fields.
- **Field Modifiers**:
  - **Ascending Order**: Specify the field name (e.g., "pub_date" or "author").
  - **Descending Order**: Prefix the field with a minus (`-`), as in `"-pub_date"`.
  - **Multiple Fields**: You can order by several fields by providing more than one argument:
    ```python
    Entry.objects.order_by('author', '-pub_date')
    ```
    - This sorts first by author (ascending) then by pub_date (descending) within each author group.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM entry ORDER BY pub_date DESC;
```
Or, with multiple fields:
```sql
SELECT * FROM entry ORDER BY author ASC, pub_date DESC;
```

---

### 1.6. `values(*fields)`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.values(*fields)
```

#### Example:
```python
# Retrieve only the id and headline of published entries.
Entry.objects.filter(status='published').values('id', 'headline')
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Returns a QuerySet of dictionaries rather than full model instances.
- **Output**: Each dictionary contains the specified field names as keys and their values.
- **Usage**: Useful when you only need certain fields and want to reduce memory overhead.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT id, headline FROM entry WHERE status = 'published';
```

---

## 1.7. `values_list(*fields, flat=False)`

### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.values_list(*fields, flat=False)
```

### Example:
```python
# Retrieve a flat list of entry IDs.
Entry.objects.values_list('id', flat=True)
```

### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Similar to `values()`, but returns tuples instead of dictionaries.
- **Output Options**:
  - If multiple fields are provided, it returns a tuple for each record (e.g., `(1, 'Headline')`).
  - If a single field is provided with `flat=True`, it returns a flat list of values.

### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT id FROM entry;
```

- **When to Use**: Choose `values_list` when you need an ordered collection of values (or tuples) without the overhead of dictionary creation.

---

# 2. Relationship Optimization

## 2.1. `select_related(*fields)`

### Signature:
```python
Book.objects.select_related('author')
```

### Example:
```python
# Retrieve books and their associated authors in one SQL query.
books = Book.objects.select_related('author').all()
for book in books:
    print(book.title, "by", book.author.name)
```

### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Optimizes retrieval of related objects (typically foreign key or one-to-one relationships) using an SQL `JOIN`.
- **How It Works**:
  - When you call `select_related('author')`, Django performs a join between the `Book` table and the `Author` table.
  - As a result, when you access `book.author`, no additional query is executed—the related object data is already available.

### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT book.*, author.*
FROM book
INNER JOIN author ON book.author_id = author.id;
```

- **When to Use**: Use for single-valued relationships. Do not use it for many-to-many or reverse foreign key relationships.

---

## 2.2. `prefetch_related(*lookups)`

### Signature:
```python
Book.objects.prefetch_related('tags')
```

### Example:
```python
# Retrieve books and prefetch many-to-many related 'tags' in separate queries.
books = Book.objects.prefetch_related('tags').all()
for book in books:
    # Accessing book.tags.all() does not hit the database again.
    print(book.title, "tags:", [tag.name for tag in book.tags.all()])
```

### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Optimizes retrieval of multi-valued relationships (e.g., many-to-many, one-to-many) by performing additional queries and caching results in Python.
- **How It Works**:
  - Django first retrieves the main objects (e.g., books) and then performs a second query to get all related objects (e.g., tags) for those books.
  - Django then “joins” these results in memory.

### SQL Equivalent:
**Main query:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM book;
```
**Prefetch query (for tags):**
```sql
SELECT * FROM tag
WHERE tag.book_id IN (list_of_book_ids);
```

**final sql:**
```sql
SELECT "tag"."id", "tag"."name", "book_tags"."book_id"
FROM "tag"
INNER JOIN "book_tags" ON "tag"."id" = "book_tags"."tag_id"
WHERE "book_tags"."book_id" IN (1, 2, 3);

```

### Difference from `select_related`:
- `select_related`: Uses SQL `JOINs` for one-to-one/foreign key relations.
- `prefetch_related`: Uses separate queries and is designed for many-to-many or one-to-many relations.

- **When to Use**: When you need to fetch related sets that could otherwise lead to the **N+1 problem** if accessed in a loop.

---

# 3. Aggregations and Annotations

## 3.1. `annotate(*expressions)`

### Signature:
```python
Blog.objects.annotate(entry_count=Count('entry'))
```

### Example:
```python
from django.db.models import Count
# Annotate each Blog with the number of related Entry objects.
blogs = Blog.objects.annotate(entry_count=Count('entry'))
for blog in blogs:
    print(blog.name, "has", blog.entry_count, "entries")
```

### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Adds calculated fields (aggregates) to each object in the QuerySet.
- **Usage**:
  - In the example, each blog gets an extra attribute `entry_count` holding the count of its entries.
  - Can combine with filtering, ordering, and other QuerySet operations.

### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT blog.*, COUNT(entry.id) AS entry_count
FROM blog
LEFT JOIN entry ON entry.blog_id = blog.id
GROUP BY blog.id;
```

### Other Aggregates:
- `Sum('field')`: Sums numeric fields.
- `Avg('field')`: Calculates the average.
- `Min('field')`, `Max('field')`: Find minimum/maximum values.

---

## 3.2. `aggregate(**kwargs)`

### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.aggregate(total=Count('id'))
```

### Example:
```python
from django.db.models import Count, Avg
# Get total count of entries and the average number of comments.
stats = Entry.objects.aggregate(total=Count('id'), avg_comments=Avg('comments'))
print(stats)  # e.g., {'total': 125, 'avg_comments': 4.6}
```

### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Computes summary values for the entire QuerySet and returns a dictionary.

### Difference from `annotate()`:
- `annotate()`: Adds a calculated field per row.
- `aggregate()`: Computes overall statistics (one result for the whole set).

### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(id) AS total, AVG(comments) AS avg_comments FROM entry;
```

---

## 4. Efficient Bulk Operations

### 4.1. `bulk_create(obj_list)`

#### Signature:
```python
Model.objects.bulk_create(obj_list)
```

#### Example:
```python
entries = [Entry(title="Entry 1"), Entry(title="Entry 2")]
Entry.objects.bulk_create(entries)
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Inserts many records in a single database query (or in a few large batches).
- **Advantages**:
  - Much faster than looping over individual `.save()` calls.
  - Reduces overhead and network round trips.
- **Caveats**:
  - Does not call the model’s `save()` method.
  - No `pre_save` or `post_save` signals are emitted.
  - Does not work with many-to-many relationships.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
INSERT INTO entry (title) VALUES ('Entry 1'), ('Entry 2');
```

---

### 4.2. `bulk_update(obj_list, fields)`

#### Signature:
```python
Model.objects.bulk_update(obj_list, fields)
```

#### Example:
```python
# Suppose you have a list of Entry objects with modified headlines.
Entry.objects.bulk_update(entries, ['headline'])
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Efficiently updates specified fields for a list of model instances.
- **Advantages**:
  - Reduces the number of `UPDATE` queries by batching them.
- **Caveats**:
  - Does not trigger individual `save()` calls or signals.
  - Primary keys cannot be updated.

#### SQL Equivalent:
Django generates one or several `UPDATE` statements, possibly using `CASE` expressions, to update many rows in one go.

---

## 5. Advanced Querying

### 5.1. Q Objects

#### Signature:
```python
from django.db.models import Q
Entry.objects.filter(Q(headline__startswith="Who") | Q(headline__startswith="What"))
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Allows complex queries by combining conditions with logical operators.
- **Usage**:
  - `|` (OR): Combines two `Q` objects with an OR operation.
  - `&` (AND): Combines conditions with an AND (this is implicit if you pass multiple `Q` objects).
  - `~` (NOT): Negates a condition.

#### Example in Detail:
```python
from django.db.models import Q
qs = Entry.objects.filter(
    Q(headline__startswith="Who") | Q(headline__startswith="What")
)
```

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM entry
WHERE (headline LIKE 'Who%' OR headline LIKE 'What%');
```

#### Using the NOT (~) Operator with Q Objects
```sql
from django.db.models import Q
# This query retrieves all Entry objects whose headline does NOT start with "Who"
entries = Entry.objects.filter(~Q(headline__startswith="Who"))
```

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM entry
WHERE NOT (headline LIKE 'Who%');
```

- **When to Use**: When conditions are too complex for simple keyword arguments.

---

### 5.2. F Expressions

#### Signature:
```python
from django.db.models import F
Entry.objects.update(views=F('views') + 1)
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Allows you to reference model fields directly in queries, performing arithmetic or comparisons at the database level.
- **Usage**:
  - Increments the `views` field by `1` for all entries without reading them into Python.
  - Can be used in filters for field-to-field comparisons.

#### Example in Detail:
```python
from django.db.models import F
# Increment the 'views' field atomically.
Entry.objects.filter(id=5).update(views=F('views') + 1)
```

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
UPDATE entry SET views = views + 1 WHERE id = 5;
```

---

### 5.3. Subqueries and OuterRef

#### Signature:
```python
from django.db.models import OuterRef, Subquery
```

#### Example:
```python
# Annotate each Post with the email of the latest Comment author.
latest_comment = Comment.objects.filter(post=OuterRef('pk')).order_by('-created_at')
posts = Post.objects.annotate(latest_commenter_email=Subquery(latest_comment.values('email')[:1]))
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Incorporates a subquery into a larger query.
- **Components**:
  - `OuterRef('pk')`: Refers to the outer query’s primary key, allowing the subquery to correlate with each row.
  - `Subquery(...)`: Wraps the subquery so that its result (e.g., a single value) is used in the outer query.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT post.id, (
    SELECT U0.email
    FROM comment U0
    WHERE U0.post_id = post.id
    ORDER BY U0.created_at DESC LIMIT 1
) AS latest_commenter_email
FROM post;
```

- **When to Use**: When you need to annotate or filter on data derived from a related subquery.

---

### 5.4. `distinct(*fields)`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.distinct(*fields)
```

#### Example:
```python
# Get entries with distinct publication dates (PostgreSQL only).
Entry.objects.distinct('pub_date')
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Removes duplicate rows from the QuerySet.
- **Usage**:
  - When called without arguments, it applies to the entire row.
  - When field names are provided (supported in PostgreSQL), it returns unique values for those fields.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT pub_date FROM entry;
```

- **Caveats**:
  - When using with `order_by()` or `values()`, be aware that additional fields may be included in the `SELECT` statement, which can affect distinct results.

---

### 5.5. `exists()`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.filter(status='published').exists()
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Checks if a QuerySet contains any results, returning `True` or `False`.
- **Usage**:
  - This method is optimized to use minimal resources (often a `SELECT 1 ... LIMIT 1` query).
  - It avoids loading full objects into memory if you only need to check for existence.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT 1 FROM entry WHERE status = 'published' LIMIT 1;
```

---

## 6. Transactions and Atomic Operations

### 6.1. `transaction.atomic`

#### Signature:
```python
from django.db import transaction
with transaction.atomic():
    # Critical database operations here.
```

#### Example:
```python
from django.db import transaction
with transaction.atomic():
    order.status = 'paid'
    order.save()
    Payment.objects.create(order=order, amount=order.total)
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Ensures that a set of database operations is executed as a single unit—either all succeed or all fail.
- **How It Works**:
  - Wraps the enclosed operations in a database transaction (using SQL `BEGIN;` and `COMMIT;`).
  - If an exception occurs, the transaction is rolled back (`SQL ROLLBACK;`).

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE order SET status='paid' WHERE id = ...;
INSERT INTO payment (...);
COMMIT;
```

- **When to Use**: Whenever you have multiple dependent operations that must succeed together to maintain data consistency.

---

### 6.2. `select_for_update()`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.select_for_update().get(pk=1)
```

#### Example:
```python
from django.db import transaction
with transaction.atomic():
    entry = Entry.objects.select_for_update().get(pk=1)
    entry.views = F('views') + 1
    entry.save()
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Locks selected rows until the transaction is complete to prevent concurrent modifications.
- **Usage**:
  - Must be used within a transaction (inside an atomic block).
  - Prevents race conditions by adding a `FOR UPDATE` clause.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
SELECT * FROM entry WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
```

- **When to Use**: In scenarios where multiple processes might try to update the same records concurrently.

---

## 7. Raw SQL Execution

### 7.1. `Model.objects.raw()`

#### Signature:
```python
Entry.objects.raw(query, params=None)
```

#### Example:
```python
qs = Entry.objects.raw('SELECT id, headline FROM entry WHERE status = %s', ['published'])
for entry in qs:
    print(entry.headline)
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Executes a raw SQL query and returns a `RawQuerySet` of model instances.
- **Usage**:
  - Ensure your SQL query returns the primary key (and any necessary fields for model instantiation).
  - Parameters should be passed separately to avoid SQL injection.

#### SQL Equivalent:
The SQL provided is executed directly.

- **Caveats**:
  - `RawQuerySet` is read-only.
  - You lose some ORM benefits such as automatic type conversion for complex relationships.

##### Model.objects.raw()
What It Is:
A convenience method that returns a RawQuerySet where each result is mapped to a model instance.

How It Works:

You supply a raw SQL query that must select the model’s primary key.
Django wraps each result into an instance of the model, automatically mapping columns to fields.
When to Use It:

For read-only operations where you want the results as model instances.
When you need to execute a raw SQL query but still want the benefits of the ORM (e.g., accessing model methods, properties, or further filtering).
Example:

```python
from myapp.models import Product

##### The query must select the primary key (id) and any fields needed for the model.
products = Product.objects.raw("SELECT id, name, price FROM myapp_product")
for product in products:
    # Each 'product' is an instance of Product, so you can use model methods and attributes.
    print(f"{product.name} costs {product.price}")
```
Summary
Direct Cursor Execution gives you full control and returns raw data (tuples or dicts), which is useful for highly customized queries or database operations not directly related to models.
Model.objects.raw() provides a higher-level interface that returns model instances, making it easier to integrate with Django’s ORM features for read-only operations.

---

### 7.2. Direct Cursor Execution

#### Signature:
```python
from django.db import connection
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute(sql, params)
```

#### Example:
```python
from django.db import connection
with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("UPDATE entry SET status = %s WHERE id = %s", ['draft', 3])
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Runs any arbitrary SQL command directly against the database.
- **Usage**:
  - Use for operations that the ORM doesn’t cover (e.g., bulk DDL changes).
  - Data retrieval for `SELECT` queries is done using `cursor.fetchone()` or `cursor.fetchall()`.

#### SQL Equivalent:
The SQL provided is executed exactly as written.

- **Best Practice**:
  - Always use parameterized queries (placeholders and a parameters list) to protect against SQL injection.

##### Direct Cursor Execution
What It Is:
You use Django’s low-level database API (via django.db.connection.cursor()) to execute raw SQL.

How It Works:

You manually execute SQL commands and fetch results as tuples (or dictionaries, if configured).
You’re responsible for parsing and mapping the results.
When to Use It:

For complex queries or operations that don’t map directly to a model.
When you need full control over the SQL and the data returned.
For operations that might modify the database (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) when you don’t require ORM-level protections or conveniences.
Example:

```python
from django.db import connection

with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    cursor.execute("SELECT id, name, price FROM myapp_product")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()  # Each row is a tuple (id, name, price)
    
for row in rows:
    print(f"ID: {row[0]}, Name: {row[1]}, Price: {row[2]}")
```

## 8. Indexing and Optimization Techniques

### 8.1. Field-Level Indexing

#### Usage:
```python
class Customer(models.Model):
    email = models.CharField(max_length=254, db_index=True)
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Improves query performance on fields that are frequently filtered or ordered.
- **How It Works**:
  - The `db_index=True` flag instructs Django to create a database index on that column during migrations.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
CREATE INDEX customer_email_idx ON customer(email);
```

- **When to Use**: For fields used in `WHERE` clauses or `ORDER BY` clauses. Note that indexes can slow down writes and take up extra space.

---

### 8.2. Model Meta Indexes

#### Usage:
```python
class Customer(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    last_name  = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    
    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=['last_name', 'first_name']),
        ]
```

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Create composite or custom indexes across multiple fields.
- **Usage**:
  - Define within the model’s `Meta` class.
  - Useful for queries that filter on multiple columns together.

#### SQL Equivalent:
```sql
CREATE INDEX customer_last_first_idx ON customer(last_name, first_name);
```

- **When to Use**: When common query patterns filter or order on multiple fields.

---

### 8.3. QuerySet Caching

#### Explanation:
- **Purpose**: Django QuerySets are lazy and cache their results upon first evaluation.
- **Usage Example:**
```python
qs = Entry.objects.filter(category='News')
list(qs)  # Executes the SQL query and caches results.
list(qs)  # Uses the cached data; no new SQL executed.
```

- **Benefit**: Reduces redundant database hits within the same `QuerySet` instance.

#### SQL Equivalent:
The first evaluation generates a SQL query; subsequent uses reuse the in-memory data.

- **Caveat**:
  - If you modify the QuerySet (e.g., call `.filter()` again), it creates a new QuerySet and new query.

---

## 9. Field for Automatic Increment Key

### 9.1. Django’s Default Primary Key Field
*(Usually an AutoField or BigAutoField)*

#### Introduction
By default, Django automatically adds a primary key field to your models if you don’t specify one. This field is typically an instance of `AutoField` (or `BigAutoField` if configured) that auto-increments with each new record. It underpins unique identification and is tied closely to the database’s integer types.

#### Questions

**Question:** What is the default field type used by Django for an automatic incrementing primary key?

**Answer:** `AutoField`

**Explanation:** When no primary key is explicitly specified, Django automatically adds an `AutoField` to your model.
