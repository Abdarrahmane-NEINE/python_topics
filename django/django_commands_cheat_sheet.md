# Essential Django Commands

## Must-Know Commands

### Create a New Django Project
```bash
django-admin startproject <projectname>
```
**Purpose:** Creates a new Django project with a preconfigured directory structure and initial settings.

**Example:**
```bash
django-admin startproject myproject
```

### Create a New Django App
```bash
python manage.py startapp <appname>
```
**Purpose:** Creates a new app within your project. Apps are modular components that encapsulate models, views, templates, etc.

**Example:**
```bash
python manage.py startapp blog
```

### Run the Development Server
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
**Purpose:** Launches Django’s built-in development server so you can run and test your project locally.

**Example:**
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
**Note:** The server runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000/ by default.

### Create Migrations
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
**Purpose:** Detects changes in your models and creates migration files (scripts that detail database changes).

### Apply Migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
**Purpose:** Applies migration files to the database, ensuring the schema is up-to-date with your models.

### Create a Superuser
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
**Purpose:** Creates a superuser (admin) account to access Django’s admin interface.

## Useful Intermediate Commands

### Open Django Shell
```bash
python manage.py shell
```
**Purpose:** Opens an interactive Python shell with your Django environment loaded. Useful for testing code snippets and querying your database.

### Run Tests
```bash
python manage.py test
```
**Purpose:** Runs the test suite for your Django apps, helping you catch issues early.

### Collect Static Files
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```
**Purpose:** Collects all static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) from your apps into a single directory defined by `STATIC_ROOT`, which is essential for production deployment.

### Show SQL Migrations
```bash
python manage.py sqlmigrate <appname> <migration_number>
```
**Purpose:** Shows the SQL statements that a specific migration will execute, offering insight into how changes are applied to the database.

**Example:**
```bash
python manage.py sqlmigrate blog 0001
```

### Export Database Data
```bash
python manage.py dumpdata > data.json
```
**Purpose:** Serializes your database content (often into JSON) for backups or data transfers.

### Load Database Data
```bash
python manage.py loaddata <fixture>
```
**Purpose:** Loads data from a fixture file (previously created using `dumpdata`) into your database.

**Example:**
```bash
python manage.py loaddata data.json
```

### Inspect an Existing Database
```bash
python manage.py inspectdb > models.py
```
**Purpose:** Generates Django model code by introspecting an existing database. This is particularly useful when integrating with a legacy database.

### Check Project Configuration
```bash
python manage.py check
```
**Purpose:** Runs system checks on your project configuration to detect potential issues before they become problematic.

## More Advanced Commands and Tools

### View Differences in Settings
```bash
python manage.py diffsettings
```
**Purpose:** Displays the differences between your current settings and Django’s default settings, helping you understand customizations and debug configuration issues.

### Internationalization Commands

#### Extract Translatable Strings
```bash
python manage.py makemessages -l <language_code>
```
**Purpose:** Extracts translatable strings from your project files for localization.

**Example:**
```bash
python manage.py makemessages -l es
```

#### Compile Translation Files
```bash
python manage.py compilemessages
```
**Purpose:** Compiles the message files (e.g., `.po` files) into binary `.mo` files that Django can use at runtime.

### Third-Party/Optional Commands

#### Django Extensions
If you install `django-extensions`, you gain access to additional commands like:
```bash
python manage.py runscript <scriptname>
```
**Purpose:** Run custom Python scripts in the Django context.

#### Celery Integration
While not a Django command per se, when using Celery for asynchronous tasks, you'll often use commands like:
```bash
celery -A myproject worker --loglevel=info
```

## Quick Tips

### Order of Operations
When you make changes to your models:
1. Run `makemigrations` to create migration files.
2. Run `migrate` to apply the changes to the database.

### Development vs. Production
- The development server (`runserver`) is convenient for testing but isn’t designed for production use.
- In production, consider using a dedicated web server (e.g., Gunicorn or uWSGI) behind a reverse proxy like Nginx.

### Interactive Testing
Use the `shell` command to quickly test model methods, query data, or experiment with Django APIs without writing a full view or script.

### Automation & Efficiency
Integrate test runs into your development cycle to ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
