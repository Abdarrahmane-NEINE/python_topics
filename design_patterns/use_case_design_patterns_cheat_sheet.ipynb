    "# Gang of Four Design Patterns – Use Cases Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a concise list of 2–3 real-world use case examples for each of the classic Gang of Four design patterns. These are high-level scenarios that illustrate where and why you might apply each pattern in your software design.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creational Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Abstract Factory\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform GUI Toolkit:** Create families of related UI components (buttons, checkboxes, text fields) that differ by operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n",
    "- **Theme-Based Component Creation:** Generate widgets with different styles (dark mode vs. light mode) without changing the client code.\n",
    "- **Database Connectivity:** Provide a family of objects (connection, command, transaction) for different databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle) via a unified interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Builder\n",
    "- **Document Generation:** Assemble complex documents (HTML, PDF, or reports) step by step, allowing different configurations (with images, tables, headers) from the same building process.\n",
    "- **Meal Preparation:** Construct a meal with various courses (starter, main course, dessert) in a customizable sequence.\n",
    "- **Vehicle Assembly:** Build different models of vehicles (cars, trucks, SUVs) by assembling parts like engines, bodies, and interiors according to specific requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Factory Method\n",
    "- **Logger Creation:** Choose between different types of loggers (file, console, network) based on configuration at runtime.\n",
    "- **Notification System:** Create notification objects (email, SMS, push notifications) based on user preference or system settings.\n",
    "- **Document Parser:** Instantiate specific parsers (XML, JSON, CSV) depending on the document type to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Prototype\n",
    "- **Graphical Object Duplication:** Clone complex graphical objects (shapes, diagrams) in a drawing application without recreating them from scratch.\n",
    "- **Configuration Objects:** Duplicate configuration settings or templates to quickly create new instances with similar properties.\n",
    "- **Game Characters:** Clone enemy or player objects with complex internal states to spawn similar entities in a game.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Singleton\n",
    "- **Configuration Manager:** Ensure a single point of access for configuration settings throughout an application.\n",
    "- **Logging Service:** Provide a unified logging service that collects logs from different parts of an application.\n",
    "- **Resource Pool Manager:** Manage shared resources (database connections, thread pools) so that only one instance coordinates access.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structural Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Adapter\n",
    "- **Legacy System Integration:** Adapt an old or incompatible interface (e.g., a legacy payment gateway) to work with a modern system.\n",
    "- **Data Format Conversion:** Convert data from one format to another (e.g., XML to JSON) so that the client can use it without change.\n",
    "- **Third-Party Library Wrapping:** Wrap a third-party library to present a simplified or customized interface that fits your application's needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Bridge\n",
    "- **Remote Control for Devices:** Separate the abstraction (remote control) from device-specific implementations (TV, DVD, Air Conditioner) so that controls can work with any device.\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform Graphics Rendering:** Decouple drawing commands from platform-specific graphics libraries, enabling the same drawing logic to work on multiple systems.\n",
    "- **Communication Protocols:** Decouple the messaging interface from the actual network protocol (HTTP, WebSocket, MQTT), allowing the interface to remain constant while changing the underlying communication method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Composite\n",
    "- **File System Hierarchy:** Represent files and directories uniformly, allowing operations (like searching, listing) to be performed on both individual files and directory structures.\n",
    "- **Organizational Chart:** Model an organization’s hierarchy where individual employees and departments (groups) can be treated uniformly.\n",
    "- **Menu Systems:** Represent nested menu items in a user interface where both individual options and submenus share common operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Decorator\n",
    "- **Dynamic Feature Addition:** Add functionality (such as logging, authentication, or caching) to an object dynamically without altering its structure.\n",
    "- **UI Component Enhancement:** Enhance visual components (adding borders, scrollbars, or shadows) without modifying the underlying component class.\n",
    "- **Stream Processing:** Wrap data streams with additional processing steps (compression, encryption) without changing the stream’s core functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Facade\n",
    "- **Simplified API for Complex Systems:** Provide a simple interface for a complex subsystem (like a multimedia library) that hides the internal complexities from the user.\n",
    "- **Home Automation System:** Create a unified interface that controls multiple subsystems (lighting, HVAC, security) in a smart home.\n",
    "- **Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP):** Offer a consolidated interface to access various subsystems (inventory, accounting, sales) in a business application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Flyweight\n",
    "- **Text Rendering:** Share common glyph objects for characters in a text editor to reduce memory usage.\n",
    "- **Game Assets:** Share common graphical assets (e.g., trees, rocks) among many instances in a game world.\n",
    "- **Web Server Caching:** Share common data (like configuration or connection settings) across multiple requests to improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Proxy\n",
    "- **Lazy Loading:** Delay the loading of a heavy resource (such as an image or file) until it is actually needed.\n",
    "- **Access Control:** Control access to a sensitive object by adding a security layer (authentication, logging) through a proxy.\n",
    "- **Remote Object Access:** Provide local representation for an object located on a remote server, managing the communication transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Behavioral Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Chain of Responsibility\n",
    "- **Event Processing Pipelines:** Pass user events (clicks, keystrokes) through a chain of handlers (validation, logging, processing) until one handles the event.\n",
    "- **Request Filtering:** Process incoming HTTP requests through a series of middleware components (authentication, authorization, caching).\n",
    "- **Error Handling:** Route error messages through a chain of error handlers until the error is resolved or logged.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Command\n",
    "- **GUI Menu Actions:** Encapsulate user actions (open, save, close) as command objects that can be executed, undone, or queued.\n",
    "- **Remote Control:** Represent remote control buttons as command objects that trigger specific actions on a device.\n",
    "- **Macro Recording:** Record a sequence of commands to replay complex user interactions later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Interpreter\n",
    "- **Mathematical Expression Evaluation:** Parse and evaluate arithmetic expressions using a tree of expression objects.\n",
    "- **Scripting Languages:** Implement a simple domain-specific language (DSL) for configuring or automating tasks in an application.\n",
    "- **Query Parsing:** Interpret and execute custom query languages for searching data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Iterator\n",
    "- **Custom Data Structures:** Provide a standard way to traverse custom collections like trees, graphs, or linked lists.\n",
    "- **Database Result Sets:** Iterate over query results without exposing the underlying data structure.\n",
    "- **Streaming Data:** Process continuous streams of data (e.g., reading lines from a large file) in a memory-efficient manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Mediator\n",
    "- **Chatroom Application:** Coordinate communication between multiple users so that each participant does not need to know about the others.\n",
    "- **Air Traffic Control:** Centralize communication among airplanes to manage landing, takeoff, and navigation.\n",
    "- **GUI Event Handling:** Manage interactions between UI components (buttons, text fields, lists) to reduce direct dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Memento\n",
    "- **Undo/Redo Functionality:** Capture and restore the state of a document or editor to support undo/redo operations.\n",
    "- **Game State Saving:** Save the state of a game so that a player can resume from a particular point.\n",
    "- **Configuration Backup:** Store snapshots of configuration settings that can be reverted if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Observer\n",
    "- **News Feed/Notification Systems:** Notify subscribers when new content or events occur, such as social media updates or stock price changes.\n",
    "- **Event-Driven Systems:** Implement a publish-subscribe model where various components react to system events.\n",
    "- **GUI Components:** Update user interface elements automatically when underlying data changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. State\n",
    "- **Vending Machines:** Change behavior based on state (e.g., waiting for coin, dispensing item) without complex conditional logic.\n",
    "- **Document Workflow:** Transition a document through states (draft, review, published) with different behaviors at each stage.\n",
    "- **Traffic Lights:** Cycle through states (red, yellow, green) where each state defines its own timing and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Strategy\n",
    "- **Sorting Algorithms:** Choose among different sorting strategies (quick sort, merge sort) based on data characteristics.\n",
    "- **Compression Techniques:** Switch between compression algorithms (zip, gzip) depending on file type or size.\n",
    "- **Route Planning:** Select the optimal route calculation algorithm (shortest path, fastest route) for navigation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Template Method\n",
    "- **Data Processing Pipelines:** Define a fixed sequence of steps for processing data, allowing subclasses to customize individual steps.\n",
    "- **Cooking Recipes:** Outline the steps for preparing a meal while allowing chefs to add their own ingredients or methods at specific steps.\n",
    "- **Report Generation:** Provide a framework for generating reports with standardized sections (header, content, footer) that can be customized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Visitor\n",
    "- **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Processing:** Traverse and perform operations on nodes in a compiler or interpreter.\n",
    "- **File System Operations:** Perform actions (e.g., counting files, calculating directory sizes) across a composite file system structure.\n",
    "- **Document Rendering:** Separate operations (like spell-checking or formatting) from the document structure by “visiting” each element.\n",
